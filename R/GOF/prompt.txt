I have peak flood discharge values for years from 2016 - 2024 (9 years), and I have done three cases by fitting Gumbel, Log Pearson Type 3 and Log Normal distributions to the data and generating predicted values (for Gumbel and Log Normal I've done using both libraries in R that do Maximum Likelihood Estimation and also manually by computing mean and stdev and using formulae, for example calculating the reduced variates for gumbel. In essence I have 2 columns for gumbel, 2 for lognormal and 1 column for LP3 predicted discharge values). I've made the predictions for both the original year return periods (calculated using weibull plotting positions) and also for standard return periods of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 years. I now want to calculate goodness of fit tests to find out which distribution is the best. I want you to walk me through all relevant GOF tests, explaining the theory and how to use it, one by one. I also want you to correct any fault in my understanding if there is any.
